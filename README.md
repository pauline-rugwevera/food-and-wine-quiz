# Design
## Colors
I created the quiz color scheme using [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/22577a38a3a557cc9980ed99). I used four colors eventually though at the beginning I had used only three. This was before I had checked the color contrast with [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), when I realised two of my colors were failing. In order not  to change everything completely, I added one more as it only covers a smaller part of the project.
